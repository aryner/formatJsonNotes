This will be a very brief look at closures and will not cover everthing there is to know about them; you can find hole articles about the topic if you are so inclined.  The way I tink about closures is that functions remember the environment in which they where created.  This matters because in javaScript scope is defined by functions, any variable defined by a function is accessible within the function but not outside of it.  But the function has access to all the variables it\'s parent environment has access to; and any function returned by a function will have access to the variables from the environment it was created in.  That\'s a fair amount of information that might not be incredialy clear, and I\'m trying to keep the scope of this post to what was covered in the meet up.  So with this in mind, I\'ll just give one example of how you might take advantage of closures.  Here we will immediately call an anonymous function using an <a href="http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/">iife</a> without adding any variables to our namespace', 'tag': 'p'}}, '5': {'title': 'Conclusion', '1': {'content': "We didn't cover everything from Eve's presentations, but I tried to cover some of the main points.
